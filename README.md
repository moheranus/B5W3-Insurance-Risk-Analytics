# B5W3: End-to-End Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the B5W3 project, focused on analyzing historical car insurance claim data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) in South Africa. The goal is to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk segments for premium adjustments using exploratory data analysis (EDA), A/B hypothesis testing, and machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Stores the insurance dataset (not tracked in Git, managed with DVC).
- `src/`: Python scripts for EDA, hypothesis testing, and modeling.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Output plots from EDA.
- `reports/`: Interim and final reports.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/moheranus/B5W3-Insurance-Risk-Analytics.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up DVC for data versioning (see Task 2).

## Tasks

- **Task 1**: Git setup, EDA, and statistical analysis.
- **Task 2**: Data versioning with DVC.
- **Task 3**: A/B hypothesis testing.
- **Task 4**: Predictive modeling.

## Key Dates

- Challenge Introduction: June 11, 2025
- Interim Submission: June 13, 2025
- Final Submission: June 17, 2025
